All of the examples that I will give were derived from the file "quantitative_analysis.py"

When doing word similarity (i.e. doing cosine similarity between two word vectors) the words "queen" and king" had a pretty high similarity of around 0.78, which is to be expected of an accurate calculation. The similarity between "king" and "man" is only around 0.53, but given that the similarity between "queen" and "woman" is about 0.60 then it seems like relative to a similar comparison (that of "queen" and "woman") "king" and "man" have an appropriate level of similarity. The similarity between "king" and "woman" is less than "king" and "man", which is expected. The similarity between "queen" and "man" is about 0.54, which is less than "queen" and "woman" but is approximately the same as "king" and "man". A better model would have a higher similarity between "king" and "man" than "queen" and "man".

When doing sentence similarity, the sentences "the woman is a queen" and "the man is a king" had about 0.90 similarity (which is expected). It also got a high score for  "the tree has a branch" and "the branch has a leaf" (about 0.93), indicating that it can represent "part of" relationships. However, both of the examples above are of sentence that have very similar words, so maybe it isn't really representing the structure of the sentence, but simply the fact that both sentences have similar words. This is proved by the comparison of the sentences "the tree has a branch" and "the branch has a tree", which have a similarity score of 1.

Finally, when looking into analogies it was able to do some very simple tasks
For instance when given the question ("king", "man") and the choices ('paint', 'portrait'), ('poetry', 'rhythm'), ('note', 'music'), ('tale', 'story'), ('week', 'year'), ('queen', 'woman')], it picked ('queen', 'woman') through both methods (by analogy and by parallelism). Nevertheless, for something more complicated like ("branch", "tree") with the choices [('note', 'music'), ('week', 'year'), ('insects', 'swarm'), ('branch', 'river'), ('engine', 'jet'), ("arm", "person")], it picked ('branch', 'river') for both methods, even though any of the other choices would be a better analogy. I suspect it is simply because both the question and the picked answer contain the word "branch".
